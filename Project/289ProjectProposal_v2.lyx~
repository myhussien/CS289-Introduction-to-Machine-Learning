Data Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data set is obtained from StarPlus fMRI data website

.
 The data set contains .mat files of seven human subjects.
 For the data of each subject, three variables are defined: info, data and
 meta.
 The variable 'info', which is a struct array, defines the experiment in
 terms of a sequence of a certain number of time intervals.
 It contains the information of each 'trial' including such as the sentence
 presented to the subject, whether the picture is presented before or after
 the sentence, the action of the subject and so on .
 During most of the time intervals, the human subject views a single picture
 and a single sentence and presses a button to indicate if the picture is
 correctly described by the sentence.
 The picture has two tokens where one is above the other is shown to the
 subject.
 The possible tokens are star(s), plus(p) and dollar(d).
 The variable 'data' contains the raw observed data.
 The raw data is a sequence of images of the subject's brain collected over
 time.
 It is a cell array, with one cell per 'trial'.
 The variable 'meta' presents the information about the data set including
 the number of trials, the number of voxels, the total number of images
 and so on.
 A sample image is shown as below:

\begin_layout Part*
Project goal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are interested in answering the following questions concerning brain
 reaction to images:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Does brain activity vary when the human subject is looking at a picture
 or a sentence? Would it be possible to train a classifier?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Does brain activity vary when the human subject is making decision? i.e.
 do we observe different activity when the human subject gives different
 answers to how well the sentence describes the image?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Does brain activity vary when the picture is showing food, buildings, animals,
 etc?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We aim to answer the above questions by developing classifiers and test
 on new data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the dimension of the problem, we would first use filters to reduce
 noise.
 Then we would apply dimensionality reduction methods to select the best
 features.
 After that, we would apply several classification techniques and use CV
 to compare their performance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Possible methods we are considering:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PCA, SVM, Bayesian classifier, kNN, Lasso, Ridge
