To run the code, please put the data \joke_data and \mnist_data in this folder.
==================================================================================
kmeans.m is the code for Problem 1.

warmup.m is the code for Problem 2.2 (simple system and KNN)

latent.m is the code for implementing PCA and evaluating the learnt vector representation by MSE

latent_2_3.m is the code for implementing 2.3 part 3 using the given loss function. The alternating
minimizing algorithm is implemented. The hyper parameter is tuned.

kaggletest.m is the code for 2.4. The kaggle test result is obtained from this file.

MSECost.m is the function for calculating MSE.
