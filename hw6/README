MSE_Error.m 			function to calculate MSE error
NeuralNetwork.m 		code for traning and validating NeuralNetwork with MSE error
OBJ_Error.m 			function to calculate error
predictNN.m 			function to predict labels with test data
trainNN.m 				function of training 
trainNNCE.m  			function of training with Cross-Entropy error
** trainNN.m can be used to train nerual network with cross-entropy error trainNNCE is used to tuning parameters for CE
NeuralNetworkCE.m 		code for traning and validating NeuralNetwork with Cross-entropy error

To run the codes, please put all the data in the same folder and then run NuralNetwork.m and NeuraNetworkCE.m
